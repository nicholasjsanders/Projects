- To search for documents that have a certain keyword, type or copy paste a keyword into the search bar and click search (this will return the top 10 sorted documents, according to keyword frequency).

- To highlight the annotation, check the 'Annotated' box and relevant category box (i.e. 'Place'), and then search as you did before. This will also provide examples of the source annoted sentences that this named entity appears in.
